Welcome to week one of this course
on source systems, ingestion, and data pipelines. This week, we're going to get started
by looking at different types of source systems and
how you can interact with these systems. As you saw in the first course of the
specialization, data generation in source systems is the first stage of
the data engineering lifecycle. And as a data engineer,
you are typically not responsible for generating this data yourself or
maintaining these source systems. But ingestion from source systems is
where all your data pipelines will begin. So it's important that you understand
how this data is generated, where and how it's stored. And some of its characteristics so
that you can build robust data pipelines with these upstream
systems as your data source. And so in this first week of this course, we'll dive into some of the details of
some common source systems, including the different types of databases,
object storage, and streaming sources. In the labs, you'll get to work
with these source systems on AWS. Then in the second week, we'll focus on setting up different
types of ingestion from source systems. After that, in week 3 of this course, we'll take a look at
the DataOps under current. You'll use infrastructure as code to
automate some of your pipeline tasks, and you'll use various tools
to monitor data quality. And then finally, in the fourth and
final week course, we'll get into orchestration to coordinate
the tasks in your data pipelines. You'll be setting up directed acyclic
graphs, or DAGs, using airflow, working with infrastructure
as code frameworks, and implementing monitoring solutions for
your data pipelines. So we're going to cover a lot
of ground in this course. Join me in the next video to get started
with a closer look at the different types of source systems.
