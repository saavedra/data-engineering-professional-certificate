Throughout these courses,
I'll be emphasizing that whatever you're working
on as a data engineer, you need to be thinking
about how you work adds value for stakeholders
in your organization. Data can be an incredibly
valuable business asset, but only when it's
managed properly. Data management is so important, in fact, that there's an
international organization, the Data Management
Association International, or DAMA dedicated
entirely to providing resources for companies and individuals to get
data management right. DAMA provides this neat
little publication, the Data Management Book of
Knowledge or DMBOK for short. As you can see, there's a lot to know when it
comes to data management. But before you
start freaking out, let me just say that
as a data engineer, you don't need to memorize
everything in this book. In fact, this is a
great reference volume. In your work as a data engineer, you'll focus on a subset
of data management tasks, and you'll share the
full responsibility of data management with teams, including software
engineering, IT, and others. In this video, I'll quickly
highlight the key aspects of data management that you need to be concerned with
as a data engineer. First of all, the DMBOK defines data management
as the development, execution, and
supervision of plans, programs, and practices that
deliver, control, protect, and enhance the value of data and information assets
throughout their life cycles. Now, that's a mouthful, and perhaps even
sounds a little vague. But let's break it
down a little bit. As a field, data management consists of many facets
and disciplines, each with their own set
of responsibilities. This can make the data management
environment confusing. The DMBOK breaks down
the different facets of data management into 11
data knowledge areas. These include data
governance, data modeling, data integration, and
interoperability, metadata, security, and more. They arrange all that
in a diagram like this. You'll be seeing more on all of these topics
throughout these courses. But as you can see
in this diagram, data governance touches all other areas of
data management. As it happens, many of
the other knowledge areas interact with each other through data governance practices. Here in this video,
I'll just focus on data governance
as it relates to a lot of the areas that will be important in your role
as a data engineer. According to another book called data governance, the
definitive guide. Data governance is
first and foremost a data management function
to ensure the quality, integrity, security, and usability of the data
collected from an organization. From this definition,
you can start to see that data governance
covers a lot of ground, everything from
data security and privacy to data
quality and usability. We touched on security and privacy a bit in
the previous video. For the purposes of this video, I'd like to zero in
on data quality, which is closely related to some of the other
key terms you've seen here like integrity,
usability, and reliability. Data quality is a deep
and nuanced topic, but at its core, this concept is relatively straightforward. High quality data is accurate, complete, discoverable, and
available in a timely manner. Beyond that, high quality data represents exactly what
stakeholders expect it to represent in terms of well defined schema
and data definitions. Data that conforms to the standards of quality
is a powerful tool in decision making and adds great value in our organization. By contrast, low quality
data might be inaccurate, incomplete, or
otherwise unusable. Low quality data can cause stakeholders to
waste their time, make poor decisions, or even
fire their entire data team. You'll learn more about
how to monitor and ensure data quality in your data
pipelines in the next course. But for now, we'll move on and take a look at the
next undercurrent. Join me in the next
video to explore data architecture as it applies to the data
ensuring life cycle.
