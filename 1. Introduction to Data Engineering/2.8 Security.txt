Before getting into how security applies to your role
as a data engineer, I'd like you to think
for a moment about how security concerns apply to your own personal
data every day. For example, you
probably don't give out your bank account
information to just anyone, and you don't publish
the passwords to all your online accounts
where others can see them. Similarly, you wouldn't
give the keys to your house to someone
you don't know in trust. In your role as a data engineer, you're entrusted
with sensitive data, whether that's the personal
and private information of your clients or proprietary
business information. The owners of that data are trusting that'll keep
their information safe. It's important to
recognize your role in bringing together the
right set of principles, protocols, and
cultural practices to ensure security in
the systems you build. In this video,
I'll cover some of those foundational
principles and best practices for
data security. When you're managing
a data pipeline and serving data to end users, you'll need to give access to the data and system resources to other users or applications. Key security principle to
keep in mind when doing so is the principle
of lease privilege. This means you give users
or applications access to only the essential data
and resources they need to do their jobs and only for
the duration that's required. You need to apply the
principle of lease privilege, not only to others
in your organization but also to yourself. That means, for example,
just like you don't give everyone a team
administrator access, when it comes to your own work, don't operate from
the root shell when it's not necessary
and don't use administrator or super
user permissions unless it's
absolutely essential. When you think about how to best secure data in your work, you need to be thinking
not only about data access but also
data sensitivity. Adhering to the principle of
lease privilege means making sensitive information visible to users only when it's
absolutely necessary. Beyond that, the best way
to protect sensitive data is not to ingest it into your
system in the first place. If you don't have a
clear purpose for ingesting and storing
sensitive data, simply don't do it, and
you'll have entirely removed the risk of
accidentally leaking that data. In today's Cloud centric world, security takes on yet
another dimension, one that requires
you to understand things like identity
and access management, or IM Rals, encryption methods,
and networking protocols. You'll see more on these topics throughout the specialization as we'll delve deeper into ensuring the security
of your data pipelines. Beyond that, security
is not just about principles and protocols,
it's also about people. Security starts
and ends with you, the individual, as well as other individuals across
your organization. When it comes to security, you should adopt a
defensive mindset. Always be cautious
when asked for credentials or for sensitive
and confidential data. Imagine potential attack
and leak scenarios and design your data pipelines and storage systems
with them in mind. When it comes to real
world data leaks, individual people
have been the source of many of the biggest
security breaches. People ignoring
basic precautions, like sharing their passwords
insecurely with others, people falling victim
to phishing attacks, where an attacker tries to
steal of sensitive information by impersonating an authority
figure or so many trust, or people otherwise acting irresponsibly while working in the company's systems and data. When it comes to security
and data engineering, it never ceases to
amaze me how often I see data engineers
leap save in AWS, S three bucket, a server, or database exposed to the public Internet when
that was not the intention. There are some simple fixes to prevent this from happening. But I often see
this happen because the data engineer simply doesn't know security best practices, or they accidentally forgot
to apply these practices. When it comes to security at
the organizational level, I've seen that all too often, organizations are set up
with a facade of security. Maybe a set of checklist
to show they're compliance with regulations
or compliance standards, but a deeper spirit of security is lacking in the
organization's culture. This approach of adhering to the letter of security without a culture and spirit of security is what I
call security theater. Security emerges
from a culture where every team member recognizes
the role in protecting data and everyone
from top to bottom embraces security as a
priority and a habit. On your journey as
a data engineer, remember that while
principles and protocols, as well as tools
and technologies, are your allies
when securing data. A true security culture emanates from a shared understanding of responsibilities and vulnerabilities across
the organization. As we progress in
the specialization, you'll get hands
on experience with security considerations as they apply to all aspects of
your data architecture. In the upcoming video, we'll take a look at the next under current in the data engineering life cycle, Data Management.
