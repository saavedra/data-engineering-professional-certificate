This specialization is all about data engineering and so far in this first
week of materials, we stayed pretty high level. We've looked at the overall data engineering life cycle
and undercurrents, some of the history
of data engineering, as well as what it
means to work with stakeholders and deliver
value for your organization. Now, like I said, right up
at the top of this week, I realized this
might not have been exactly what you expected when you signed up
for these courses. But like I said before, that high level mental
framework and way of thinking like a data engineer is important for
everything that follows. Is something we'll be revisiting throughout
these courses. As a data engineer, the actual set of tools
and technologies you work with could be quite different from one
company to the next. As I talked about in the video on the history of
data engineering, with the advent of
the public Cloud and a proliferation of open source and proprietary tools available, companies of all sizes and
across all industries now have access to the same set of high performance tools
and technologies. Many companies today
are choosing to build their data systems
entirely on the Cloud. But not that long ago, the only option was for
companies to build and to maintain their own data
infrastructure in house, otherwise known as
on premises systems. Today, there are still
companies that maintain some or all of their data
infrastructure on premises, and in certain cases
that could be due to regulatory constraints or just that the company has
some legacy systems, they prefer to
maintain on premises. As a data engineer out
in the wild today, it's possible that you
could be at a company that has some on premises systems, or you may even be tasked with migrating and on premise
system to the Cloud. It's becoming increasingly
likely, however, that you'll work
as a data engineer will take place
exclusively on the Cloud. Although AWS was the first
popular public Cloud and remains the most
widely used today, you may encounter other cloud providers depending
on where you work, such as Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft, Azure, among others. In the specialization,
we won't dwell on the nuances or
considerations you might encounter if you
need to work with an on premise system or migrate from on
premises to the Cloud. Instead, we'll be taking a Cloud first approach
to prepare you for the scenarios you're most likely to encounter
as a data engineer. We've partnered with AWS in the development
of these courses, and so in the lab exercise, you'll be building
data pipelines and architectures on the AWS Cloud, using the same tools and technologies that
are being used by thousands of companies worldwide in their own data
infrastructure. By the end of this first course, you'll be able to take a set of technical requirements
for your system, like we talked about
in the last lesson and stand up a data pipeline with the appropriate set
of Cloud based tools and technologies to meet
those requirements. The AWS Cloud comprises an expansive set of
resources and tools. In this specialization, my
aim is not to teach you all there is to know about data
engineering on AWS, instead, we'll be taking a
just in time approach where you'll learn how to use specific tools for each lab directly as
you encounter them. In this way, there's no
prerequisite knowledge of Cloud computing required to be successful in these courses. With that being said, however, having some broader familiarity with Cloud computing basics and terminology will help you build context as you proceed
through these courses. To introduce the tools
and resources of AWS, I'll be joined by Morgan Willis, who is a principal Cloud
technologist specializing in teaching people how to be
successful on the AWS Cloud. Join me in the next
video to meet Morgan.
