At AWS, we describe the
cloud as the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with
pay-as-you-go pricing. In other words, this means that AWS is designed to provide
you with the resources you need to build
your data systems or other applications
essentially in an instant, when you need them,
and you can shut those resources down when
they are no longer needed. At the end of each month, you only pay for what you use. As Joe mentioned earlier, this is a very
different paradigm from building your own
on-premises data center, where you would typically
be committed to any IT resource purchases
for years to come. When I say IT resources, I'm talking about
things like compute, storage, and
networking resources. On AWS, compute resources are places to run code
like virtual machines, container hosting services,
or serverless functions. Storage resources are
places to store your data, including services like the Amazon Simple
Storage Service or S3, or Amazon Elastic Block Store, as well as database services, where you can run
relational databases, NoSQL databases, graph
databases, and more. Networking resources
allow you to connect other resources to each other and to the
outside Internet. An example of a
networking resource is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, where you have your own
private network in the cloud. Beyond compute, storage,
and networking, there are many
more categories of AWS resources and services
in areas like security, data streaming, ingestion,
transformation, and others. The advantage of building your
data systems on the cloud is that cloud resources
are scalable and elastic. What I mean by that
is, for example, if you are building a data
pipeline that includes S3 object storage as
part of the solution, you don't need to
worry ahead of time about exactly how much
storage capacity you'll need. You don't need to manage
the scaling operations as your dataset
grows or shrinks. Instead, the service
automatically scales up and down.
It's elastic. The same type of scalability and elasticity also exists
for other AWS services. This means you don't need to guess capacity ahead of time. Can always be ready
for spikes and demand or changing
traffic to your system, and you can more easily avoid paying for resources
that you don't need. Think of using AWS like how
you consume electricity. With electricity,
you only pay for what you use and at
the end of the month, when you pay your
bill, the details of how that electricity was made or delivered to your house are all
abstracted from you. AWS resources and
services are hosted in physical data centers that AWS has built out
all over the world, and you use these services over the Internet through APIs, which allows you to
build solutions without needing to build out and
manage your own data centers. When you're using AWS, you won't be thinking in
terms of single data centers. Instead, you'll deploy resources into what are
called AWS regions, which are collections
of data centers within geographical areas where
you can use AWS services. Hosting your solutions in a geographically
distributed manner like this ensures the reliability and availability
of your systems, and allows for resilience
in the event that an individual data
center goes offline due to a natural disaster
or some other problem. AWS regions are named after
their geographic area, like US East Northern Virginia, or Asia Pacific Mumbai, or Europe Frankfurt as examples. Each AWS region comprises
multiple availability zones, otherwise known as AZs, which are smaller groupings of data centers
within the region. AZs are designed to be far enough away from
each other that if something happens like an
electrical outage, a flood, or other AZ-level failure, they can fail over to the
other AZs in the region, which can then absorb
the traffic so your systems are
unaffected by the issue. So the way it works is that multiple data centers make
up one availability zone, and multiple availability
zones make up an AWS region. When you create
resources on AWS, you select the region and also potentially the
availability zone, depending on the
service you're using. Then behind the scenes, these data centers and
availability zones are connected to each other with low latency links that run on the AWS global network of fiber cables connecting
all of these facilities. In your work as a data engineer, you will often combine multiple AWS resources
and services together, like building blocks
to form solutions. AWS offers over 200
services with some being more general purpose and others being more specific in
their intended use. There is more to the AWS
global infrastructure, but this is a good start. The concepts we covered
in this video will come up again and again as you
learn more about AWS. Stick with me for the upcoming video as we explore some of the core AWS services you'll be working with
in these courses.
