Welcome to Week 2. This week, you'll dive deep into the data engineering life
cycle and undercurrents, which we introduced
in the previous week. As you saw in Week 1, the life cycle begins with data generation
from source systems over here on the left, which is really a
stage that happens before your job as a
data engineer begins. Then we'll look at ingestion,
transformation, storage, and serving of data for multiple use cases like
analytics and machine learning. Or in simpler terms, we'll be looking at
how in your job as a data engineer you'll work to get raw data
from somewhere, turn it into something
useful and then make it available for
downstream use cases. In the second lesson
of this week, we'll look at the undercurrents of the data engineering
life cycle, security, data
management, data ops, data architecture,
orchestration, and software engineering. Now, just to be clear, I want to emphasize
that this week, just like the previous
week of materials, is more focused on a high
level mental framework for data engineering
than it is about actually building
data infrastructure. This is because I believe
it's really important to get that mental framework in place
before you start building. This will make you
more successful in all aspects of your work
as a data engineer. But with that being
said, this week isn't all about theory. At the end of the
week, we'll look at how this mental framework comes together in practice
on the AWS Cloud. In the lab activity, you'll be working with
your first end to end Cloud data pipeline. Join me in the next
video to begin by looking at data generation
and source systems.
