We've been looking at the
data engineering life cycle and how you'll ingest
data from source systems, transform it, store it, and serve it to end users. As a field, data engineering
is rapidly maturing, whereas just a decade ago, the role of a data engineer was primarily focused on
the technology layer. The continued abstraction and simplification of tools has expanded the scope of the role. Data engineering now encompasses far more than just
tools and technologies. In other words, the field is
moving up the value chain, which is great news for
you as a data engineer. Modern data engineering
incorporates traditional enterprise practices
such as data management, and cost optimization,
as well as newer practices like DataOps. When it comes to work
as a data engineer, there's a set of such
practices that will apply to your work across
the entire life cycle. In the fundamentals of
Data Engineering book, we describe these practices as the undercurrents of the
data engineering life cycle. These undercurrents include
security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and
software engineering. The next several videos, we'll take a closer look at
each of these undercurrents. After that, you'll begin exploring how the data
entering life cycle and undercurrents take
shape in real life on the AWS Cloud.
Let's get started.
