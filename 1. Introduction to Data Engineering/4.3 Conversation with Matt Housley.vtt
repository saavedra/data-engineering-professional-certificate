00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.154
So I've got a very special guest for
you, my co author and best friend,

2
00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.278
Matt Housley.

3
00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:09.014
It's good to see you.

4
00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:10.022
>> It's great to be here, Joe.

5
00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:11.414
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you for the invitation.

6
00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:12.278
>> Absolutely.

7
00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.340
>> So yeah, we wrote this book together,

8
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.950
and that was kind of the starting
point ultimately for this course.

9
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.822
Maybe you could talk a bit about
what motivated us on the book.

10
00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:25.016
>> Yeah.
So, fundamentals of data engineering was

11
00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:30.029
written from a place of noticing
a gap in the book space and

12
00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.360
the education of data engineering.

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.652
The materials were largely focused on
tools and technologies and didn't really

14
00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:44.173
take a step back and attempt to define the
field of data engineering itself, the more

15
00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:49.288
provide a mental framework for how to
operate and think like a data engineer.

16
00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:54.858
And so, really, that's the perspective
that we entered into writing the book

17
00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:59.931
from, is that we didn't really want
to write a tutorial on technology,

18
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:03.422
X, Y, or Z or cloud provider ABC or
whatever, but

19
00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:08.732
really provide a first principles look
at the field of data engineering.

20
00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:13.662
>> Yeah, fundamentally, I think our
starting audience, our core audience for

21
00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:17.023
the book was people who had
a technical background but

22
00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:19.580
wanted to move into data engineering.

23
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.108
We also kind of had various
secondary audiences.

24
00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:25.986
So, for example, if you were a product
manager who was somewhat technical and

25
00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.511
needed to work a lot with data engineers
on data products or data that was

26
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:33.630
embedded into your application, we also
thought this book would help you a lot.

27
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.718
Maybe not every piece of it, but
you would have a lot to learn there.

28
00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:40.350
And I think the idea that the audience for
this course is very similar.

29
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.383
People moving into data engineering, but
also people who can benefit just from

30
00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:48.390
a better understanding of the concepts and
a little bit of hands on exposure.

31
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.044
>> So we talked about the book, and
the learner's taking a course, obviously.

32
00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:55.956
So how do these things tie together?

33
00:01:55.956 --> 00:02:01.188
I think that fundamentally, the book and
this course complement each other.

34
00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:05.129
You've already learned about
the data engineering lifecycle and

35
00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:10.051
the undercurrents, but this course allows
you to apply that mental framework with

36
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:14.340
hands on examples that you're likely
to encounter in the real world.

37
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.058
And so for this course, we're using tools
and technologies and a very popular cloud,

38
00:02:20.058 --> 00:02:24.443
AWS that will give you the hands
on experience to really tie again,

39
00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:29.299
the concepts that you learned in the book
with a practical know how of hands

40
00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.942
on labs and practice.

41
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:36.470
So we often get questions about
how to get into data engineering.

42
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.183
Maybe you can talk a little
bit about some advice for

43
00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:41.750
people who want to get
into data engineering.

44
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.862
>> Yeah so I think, first of all,

45
00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:47.848
it's very helpful to learn
just core data at concepts.

46
00:02:47.848 --> 00:02:51.698
I think we frequently find that
even if you're coming from like,

47
00:02:51.698 --> 00:02:56.248
a software development background,
you may not have enough experience with

48
00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.064
kind of how analytics data is
used to immediately jump into it.

49
00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:03.210
And so it's helpful to start with
just playing around with data,

50
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.271
even in something like Microsoft Excel, so
you know what tabular data looks like and

51
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.558
what kinds of things you
consume with data, and

52
00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:12.280
then you can sort of expand
the circle from there.

53
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.615
I think one thing we always want
to emphasize is that getting into

54
00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:17.962
data engineering, getting your first job,

55
00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:21.012
is not just about learning
a particular stack of tools.

56
00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:24.987
Rather, in those early stages,
it's good to get experience with a lot of

57
00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:27.836
different tools to develop
general competence.

58
00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:31.420
And then when you start getting into
roles, you're going to really focus down

59
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.788
on the tech stack within the company
where you're working, right?

60
00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:38.896
>> Yeah, and I think that's where a book
like fundamentals of data engineering

61
00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:43.255
really helps, is it provides you with the
mental framework to start thinking like

62
00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:44.348
a data engineer.

63
00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:49.700
And when you have that mental framework,
then you can basically put whatever

64
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.400
tools into the proper buckets and you'll
be able to function as a data engineer.

65
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.592
Well, Matt, this has been a great
discussion about the book and the course.

66
00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:01.271
Maybe if you're up for it,

67
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:05.067
we can do a mock conversation where
I will be a data engineer and

68
00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:09.666
we're going to talk to you, who is going
to play the role of a chief technology

69
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:14.706
officer at this fictitious e commerce
company that I've been hired to work at.

70
00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:18.703
>> Joe and I, running ternary data
together and doing consulting,

71
00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:23.935
had the privilege of working with a lot of
different companies from various domains,

72
00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:28.805
ranging from technology companies to
operational and logistics companies and

73
00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:31.929
in scale,
all the way down to ten person startups,

74
00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:35.490
all the way up to like big
multinational enterprises.

75
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.808
And so in that process, we learned a lot
about the kinds of things that sea level

76
00:04:39.808 --> 00:04:44.522
executives in general and chief technology
officers specifically care about when it

77
00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:47.296
comes to engineering and
when it comes to data.

78
00:04:47.296 --> 00:04:48.304
>> Well, thanks Matt.

79
00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.053
Why don't we jump into the mock
conversation with the chief technology

80
00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:54.000
officer and me, the data engineer?
