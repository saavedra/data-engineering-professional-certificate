My goal in creating these
courses is to set you up for success in your work as a data engineer. So let's pause for a minute and
visualize what success looks like. Any company that hires you as a data
engineer does so because they believe you will add value for the organization just
the same as any other employee, really. I recently spoke to my friend Bill Inman,
who's one of the thought leaders and most knowledgeable people
in the field of data. When I asked him about what advice he
would give someone who is starting out in the industry, he emphasized the importance
of finding and delivering business value. Here's what Bill said,
what advice do you have for somebody who's getting
started in the field of data? >> I'm going to give them the same
advice as if they were a bank robber. Go to where the money is if
you want to have long term, great success in our industry,
find business value. Don't get hung up on every
technology that comes out. Every new fangled thing that comes out,
go to where there's business value. Because at the end of the day, business value drives
everything we do in technology. And it's easy to get lost and
hung up on technology. And there's nothing wrong with technology. Heck, I'm a technician myself,
I love technology. But the number one thing you
need to think about now, if you don't care about success and
you want to go off and do some fancy stuff that looks interesting
and whatever, then go ahead and do it. But don't expect to have any great
reward for what you've done. So, like Willie Sutton said,
in terms of why did he rob banks? Because that's where the money is. Why do you do with technology,
you look for business value. Okay, so as a data engineer,
you need to look for business value. But what does it actually mean
to add value as a data engineer? Well, in my experience,
business value is somewhat, you might say, in the eye of a beholder. And what I mean by that is, for example,
suppose your organization is hoping that your work as a data engineer
can help with revenue growth. In this case, if your manager or
those in leadership perceive your work as contributing to the growth of revenue for
the company, then congratulations, it's highly likely you'll be recognized
as adding value for the organization. On the other hand, if your work as a data
engineer is perceived as simply costing large sums of money with little or
no return on investment, then you might need to start looking for
another job. But in many cases, business value is
not just as simple as profit and loss. It takes many different forms,
as we looked at in the previous video. In your work as a data engineer,
you'll interact with various stakeholders. Oftentimes, it'll be those
stakeholders who decide for themselves whether you're adding value. And in general, that means whether or not they perceive you as helping
them achieve their goals. Notice that in all these examples,
I'm talking about how your work is perceived rather than what
it is that you actually do. The amount of value you provide for
the business and the stakeholders, will be determined by those to
whom you are providing that value. And so in general, when you're fulfilling
stakeholder needs, you're providing them with value, whether that comes
in the form of increased revenue, cost savings, work made more efficient,
or something else, like helping with
a successful product launch. With all that being said, once you
successfully identified all the data needs of stakeholders in your organization,
it's not uncommon to discover that their collective needs far exceed the capacity
or resources you have to create solutions. And so you'll need to prioritize, figure
out which projects are more feasible and how long they might take to implement,
among many things. Now, realistically, I think figuring out
exactly what to focus on and how to best spend your time as a data engineer could
be the subject of an entire other course. So I won't go further into the details
here, but if you're curious, you can check out the link in
the resources section at the end of this week to a podcast that Matt Housley and
I did with our friend Sol Rashidi. Where she provides insight and perspective as a data executive on
what business value really means. But for now, we're going to move on. Assuming you figured out what
sort of system you want to build, the next step is identifying
the requirements for that system. Join me in the next video for
a look at gathering system requirements.
