Last week, we took a brief look at data
architecture and how, in your work as a data engineer, you'll be most successful
if you can think like an architect, even if data architect is
not technically your role. This week, we're going to dive deeper into what it
means to build good data architecture. We'll first take a look at how data
architecture fits within the broader context of enterprise architecture,
which is to say, the architecture for your entire organization. After that, we'll look at some
specific architecture examples and how you can start to think about
translating stakeholder needs into technology choices for your data systems. I'll also share with you some guiding
principles you can keep in mind as you're learning to
think like an architect. In the lab this week, you'll be evaluating the trade-offs when
it comes to things like cost, performance, scalability and security for an actual
data architecture on the AWS cloud. You'll also get a chance to explore
the AWS well architected framework, which is a complimentary set of principles
that can help you design robust and effective data systems. By the end of this week, you'll be armed
with a set of tools that will serve you at all stages of your data
engineering journey. Join me in the next video to get started.
